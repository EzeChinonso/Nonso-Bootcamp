//this is an empty contract with no funtions
//the goal is to make this contract have a balance greater than zero
//to do this we have to forcefully send money to the contract
//for us to achieve this we create another proxy contract with value and use a hidden solidity feature selfdestruct
//selfdestruct allows us to destroy a contract. When called it destroys a contract and automatically sends any value in the contract to the owner of the SC
//I know its starting to make sense now.....ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤“
//all we have to do is make the owner of our proxy SC our force SC instance address.
