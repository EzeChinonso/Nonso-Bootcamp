//Phewww ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯....This one took me a while :)
//It seems solidity integers are not actually integers
//Note: The difference between two uint, is another uint, that is the difference will always be equal or greater than zero! 
//Thus, the condition balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0 will always evaluate to true
//Therefore, 20-21 = 2^256 - 1. This is as a result of solidity underflow, which results from unsafely extracting a uint from another
//To avoid this underflows and overflows in solidity use the safemath library from openzeppelin

//In Console
//await contract.transfer("instance-address", 21)
